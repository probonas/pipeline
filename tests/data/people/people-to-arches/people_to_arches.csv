Today, Hirschl & Adler specializes in American and European paintings, watercolors, drawings, and sculpture from the eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries; American prints of all periods; and American decorative arts from 1810 to 1910. Its contemporary arm, Hirschl & Adler Modern, shows a comprehensive array of American and European art from the Post-War period. Each year, the gallery assembles about a dozen special exhibitions exploring historical and contemporary themes, or examining the work of individual artists, past and present. Most of these exhibitions are accompanied by scholarly catalogues and other publications. The gallery maintains an active group of clients, including private collectors, museums, architects, interior designers, art consultants, and other dealers.
