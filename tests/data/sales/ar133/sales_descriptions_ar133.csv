(The first was held on Apr.30, no.1511 and the second on May 6, no.1516.)  As is the case with the earlier sales, none of the extant copies of the catalogue is annotated with the names of the sellers, but a list included by the auctioneer shows how the proceeds were divided among the consigners.  Once more the list consists entirely of minor dealers, among whom Spackman and Hawkins are the principal consigners.  It is unlikely that any of them were artists.  The results were also much the same; the prices were generally low, and only three lots sold for more than £3. (B. Fredericksen)",yes,CATALOGUES-1373,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title page of the present part does not specify the name of the owner, and the auctioneer's (CL) catalogue mentions the names of only two consigners: the dealer Woodburn, who had sent in a few miscellaneous lots, and Henry Philip Hope, who owned lots 80 and 81.  Most of the remaining lots are lacking a seller's name.  However, many of these were bought in by DLH who is certainly identifiable as the French dealer, Alexis Delahante, and since at least one lot, no.99, had been purchased earlier by Delahante, one can reasonably claim that everything that did not belong to Woodburn or Hope was his.  This also corresponds to the information on the title page which indicates that the paintings, which are described as being of superior merit, had recently been consigned from the continent, i.e., imported by Delahante. Judging from the results of the sale, it would appear that Delahante was attempting to liquidate excess stock since most of the lots were sold and many for prices under £10, an indication that the reserves had been set lower than usual.  Only 15 lots were bought in, but these included all but two of the paintings that exceeded £40, a relatively low benchmark for the kind of paintings normally owned by Delahante.  The highest price was £82.19 paid by John Woodburn for a St. Catherine by Giulio Romano.  The only other comparable price was £58.16 paid by the dealer Philip Hill for an Interior View of the Church of St. Jacques, Antwerp by P.S. van Ehrenberg.  (See also G.
