There were also a few lots of drawings and prints.  The only proprietor mentioned on the title page is Daniel Mansveld (1726-1806), a resident of Amsterdam whose profession remains unknown.  At the time of his marriage in 1776 he was living op de Agterburgwal (GAA, DTB Ondertrouw inv. fol.566), and he was buried in the Westerkerk on April 28, 1806 (GAA, DTB Begraven inv.1106, fol.15).  Three extant copies of the catalogue that belonged to co-organizers of the sale are annotated with letters next to the individual lots indicating that a number of other consigners were included; two copies, JPGM and RKDH, also identify them, but with slightly different results.  The former lists just six owners, designated A, B, R, S, V, and Y, while the RKDH catalogue adds C and subdivides V into five groups. Most, but not all, of the letters correspond to the first letters of the names of the consigners, but the five owners represented by V (Jacobus Vinkeles) are not named. The full list from the RKDH catalogue reads as follows:  A = Mansveld; B = Van der Voort; C = Coclers; D, E, F, G, J = Vinkeles; R = Roos; S = Van der Schley; and Y = Yver, the last four being dealers involved with the organization of the sale.  The pictures consigned by Roos, Van der Schley and Yver, like Vinkeles, may have also belonged to still other collectors whose names are not recorded.  In fact, the JPGM catalogue, which belonged originally to Roos, is annotated with a few secondary names, such as Vos by lot 6, Flen(?) by lot 66, and Ruel(?) by lot 121, who were no doubt the true owners.  This might imply, in turn, that the other lots in the group were Roos's own property. Roos's consignment was the largest of the sale, comprising 141 lots altogether.  However, the individual pictures were inexpensive and apparently old stock of which he wanted to dispose.  The return from his lots came to just fl. 1498:16.  The most valuable pictures were those belonging to Van der Voort.  He submitted 26 lots altogether that fetched fl. 6272:15.  Mansveld's consignment consisted of 23 lots that realized fl. 4394.  One of Vinkeles's unnamed consigners can also be identified: G was certainly the dealer Willem Gruyter, and many of his paintings can be traced to earlier sales where he acquired them.  His consignment included 68 paintings altogether, but brought only fl. 561:9. The most expensive lot in the sale was no.49, a depiction of Christ and the Adulteress by Eeckhout that belonged to Mansveld and was bought by the French dealer Lafontaine for fl. 1430, an unusually high price for a work by this master.  (This may be the painting later in the Six collection in Amsterdam, sold in 1923.)  Another high price, fl. 1220, was paid by the dealer Van Iperen for lot 82, an Italian genre scene by Karel Dujardin consigned by Van der Voort. (It was most recently in the S. Steinberg collection in New York, from which it was sold in 1991.)  Two marine pictures by Backhuysen and Van de Cappelle brought fl. 730 and fl. 760, respectively, but have not been traced.  Among identifiable pictures from this sale are the Marriage Contract of Tobias and Sarah by Aert de Gelder (now in the Brighton Art Gallery and Museum) and the Interior with a Still life by Jan der Heyden (now in the Budapest museum). The total receipts were fl. 14,490:9, and the unsold lots came to fl. 2079:10.  (B.

Some copies of the catalogue also have a four-page appendix with additional prints, etc.  The owner was Jean-Jacques van Outryve, Seigneur de Merckem (1740-1815), a military officer recently deceased, and the sale was held in his home in Bruges. The descriptions of he individual lots are generaly much longer than usual, and include the dimensions and support as well as a few clues about their origins. The artists were almost entirely Flemish or Dutch, and in addition to religious subjects there were also landscapes, still lifes and portraits. The prices recorded in the BEMa II copy of the catalogue indicate that the collection was comprised of reasonably valuable pieces, although only two lots fetched more than 100 francs.  The first lot, a triptych with Christ Walking on the Water by Frans Pourbus, was the most expensive item.  The catalogue entry states that it had once been in the Chapelle de Saint Christophe, à l'Autel des Francs Poissoniers in Bruges, most probably having been removed from that location in fairly recent times.  (It is now in the Musées des beaux-arts in Brussels, and is recognized as being primarily the work of Pieter Pourbus, with the outside of the wings by Frans Pourbus the Elder.)  It was knocked down to Berlant for 200 francs, but since it reappears with 17 other paintings from this sale -- including seven others bought by Berlant -- at an anonymous auction held in Bruges on May 22, 1821, it appears that it was merely bought in on the present occasion.  In addition to those lots recorded as being sold to Berlant, the paintings knocked down to Weemaer also seem to have been bought in. Among the lots that apparently changed hands the most costly was lot 38, an interior with six persons by Jacob van Oost the Elder, which realized 105 francs.","yes","BELGIANCATS-140","","","http://portal.getty.edu/books/frick_1145340678","","","","","","","","",""

The auctioneer's (CL) copy of the catalogue indicates that the bulk of the lots on the first day had been consigned by a certain Capt. West, and so he is presumably the gentleman in question.  His full identity has not been found. The nobleman of the second day's sale was apparently the Earl of Bristol, whose name is written on the cover of the JPGM copy of the catalogue.  The auctioneer's catalogue does not refer to him by name, and most of the lots are shown to be the property of Cleasby, about whom nothing is known. However, Bristol's ownership is confirmed by the fact that all thirteen of the unsold lots from this group reappeared at Christie's on June 19 (no.129) as belonging to him.  Cleasby may therefore have been a factotum or agent of Bristol since Bristol was in Italy throughout this period. The paintings consigned by Bristol/Cleasby were primarily by Italian artists, and ten of the less prominent items, lots 6-15, are described as Antique Pictures, presumably fourteenth- or fifteenth-century pieces from the same school.  It is well known that Bristol was one of the earliest British collectors to appreciate such works and many have since proved to be works of considerable importance, although they were little valued at the time. One of the antique items in the present sale, lot 14, is almost certainly identifiable with the small Holy Family by Simone Martini now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.  It was purchased on the present occasion by Col. Matthew Smith for just £5.15. The most expensive items in the sale were among the later paintings in Bristol's consignment.  The highest price, £162.10, was paid by Simpson, probably the dealer George Simpson, for a painting described as The Virgin, Child and St. John by Leonardo da Vinci.  (It is subsequently untraced.)  The other results were much more modest: a head by Mengs, also from Ld. Bristol, was bought by the dealer Peter Delcour for £78.5, but only two other works, both from other consigners, surpassed £50.  A group of pictures belonging to the French dealer Maurice Rubichon had little success, and a smaller group submitted by Lord Yarmouth was mostly bought in.  (B.
